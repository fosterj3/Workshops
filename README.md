# Workshops

Introduction to tidymodels will teach you core tidymodels packages and their uses: data splitting/resampling with rsample, model fitting with parsnip, measuring model performance with yardstick, and model optimization using the tune package. Time permitting, you’ll be introduced to basic pre-processing with recipes. You’ll learn tidymodels syntax as well as the process of predictive modeling for tabular data.
